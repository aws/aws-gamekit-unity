# AWS GameKit Editor Window State
These files are used by the AWS GameKit editor windows to remember their state.

For example, to remember the last used page in the Settings window.

These files should not be tracked in your version control system. AWS GameKit includes a .gitignore file which excludes
these files from Git for you.
